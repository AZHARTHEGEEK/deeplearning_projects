# Binary Classification Sonar Project 1 for the Navy:Mines vs. Rocks
##Tasks
- [ ] How to load training data and make it available to Keras.
- [ ] How to design and train a neural network for tabular data.
- [ ] How to evaluate the performance of a neural network model in Keras on unseen data.
- [ ] How to perform data preparation to improve skill when using neural networks.
- [ ] How to tune the topology and configuration of neural networks in Keras.

# What we achieved doing this Project for the Navy:
## In this post, you discovered the three API styles used in Keras Deep Learning library in Python.

## You learned how you can work through a binary classification problem step-by-step with Keras, specifically:

- [x] How to load and prepare data for use in Keras.
- [x] How to create a baseline neural network model.
- [x] How to evaluate a Keras model using scikit-learn and stratified k-fold cross validation.
- [x] How data preparation schemes can lift the performance of your models.
- [x] How experiments adjusting the network topology can lift model performance.
